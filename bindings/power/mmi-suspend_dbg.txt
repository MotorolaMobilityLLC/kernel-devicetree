* MMI_SUSPEND_DBG (MMI Suspend Debug)

The /sys/private/ is a sysfs interface added for showing and changing
gpio's configuration. It's usefual to debug bottom-rock current by
comparing and setting gpio's configuration before suspend. Because GKI
has restricted the change of suspend.c in common, add a platform device
and do the debugging work in noirq suspend callbacks.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "mmi,suspend_dbg"

Example:

	motorola, private {
		compatible = "mmi,suspend_dbg";
	};
